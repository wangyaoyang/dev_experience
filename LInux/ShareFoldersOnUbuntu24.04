Q: If Network shares don't show up in 24.04 ?

A: There are a number of changes to network discovery in 24.04. You will notice there is no longer a "Windows Network" under Networks since smb1 has been disabled on most modern systems.

There are two ways the Linux guest can discover network hosts: Avahi and WS-Discovery

On Ubuntu make sure both of these are installed:

sudo apt install avahi-daemon
sudo apt install wsdd
